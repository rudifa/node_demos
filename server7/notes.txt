It makes sense to have the timeout shorter than the repetition period, e.g. 5 s vs 10 s.

It seems that the query hangs when there are no new tweets since the last time.

Try a longer rep period 


var Twitter contains 
    {
        EventEmitter : eventEmitter,  // The event broadcaster
        latestTweet : 0               // The ID of the latest searched tweet		
    };
    
    
since_id=0 did not seem to work even in the browser

Could get latest N tweets, then work backwards using max_id

Should accumulate tweets in the server
