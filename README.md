node_demos by rudifa
====================

The first three demo projects are based on the tutorial at http://www.nodebeginner.org/

**server1.js** is a minimal node server just serving a hello-world static page

**server2.js** demonstrates using local modules (router and handlers) and
several node modules to handle html input fields, a POST request 
and serving a picture file (harcoded)

**server3.js** demonstrates the browser user selecting a picture file to upload,
parsing the request with module formidable, uploading and displaying the uploaded file
Precondition : npm install formidable

**server4.js** demonstrates posting contents on an input text field and getting it back into the js code via page update
